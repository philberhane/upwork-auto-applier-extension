  <h1>Upwork Auto Applier – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <strong>November 8, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the Upwork Auto Applier browser extension and companion backend service
    (collectively, the “Service”) collect, use, and protect personal data. By installing or using the Service,
    you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We only process the data required to submit the Upwork proposals you explicitly queue.</li>
    <li>Data is encrypted in transit and removed after the automation completes.</li>
    <li>We never sell, share, or use the data for advertising or analytics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The Service processes the following information that you provide while using the extension:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Session identifiers</strong> you enter so the extension can attach to your Apify actor session.</li>
    <li><strong>Proposal content</strong> (cover letters, screening responses, job preferences) required to submit the application on Upwork.</li>
    <li><strong>Automation metadata</strong> such as timestamps, job URLs, and internal status flags needed to report success or failure back to the actor.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate the extension with your active Apify session.</li>
    <li>Populate and submit the Upwork proposal forms you requested.</li>
    <li>Provide status updates back to your actor run.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The data is never sold, leased, or shared with third parties.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Session data is stored temporarily in memory or short-lived storage while the automation runs.</li>
    <li>Proposal content is retained only for the duration of the submission process and discarded when the session ends.</li>
    <li>We do not maintain long-term logs of user-generated proposal text.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All communication between the extension and the backend is encrypted via HTTPS.</li>
    <li>Backend access is protected with API keys that you configure in Apify.</li>
    <li>We periodically review permissions to ensure the extension requests only what is required for its single purpose.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share personal data with any third parties. Data flows only between the extension, the backend controlled by us, and your Apify actor run.</p>

  <h2>User Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may remove the extension at any time to stop all data processing.</li>
    <li>You may request deletion of any residual data by contacting us at the email below.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Service is intended for professional freelancers and is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy as the Service evolves. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date. Your continued use of the Service after any revisions signifies your acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
